Project Objective
This is a Command-Line Inventory Management System that allows adding, deleting, updating, and searching items in stock. The project demonstrates the use of Data Structures such as Lists, Dictionaries, Sorting techniques, and File Handling in Python.

Features Implemented
• Add new items to inventory
• Delete items by Item ID
• Update item details (quantity/price)
• Search items by ID
• Display inventory sorted by Name, Quantity, or Price
• Low Stock Alerts
• Calculate Total Inventory Value
• Persistent data storage using a JSON file

How to Run the Project

Ensure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).

Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and load the project folder.

Open the file named main.py.

Run the program.

Use the on-screen menu to perform actions like Add, Delete, Update, Search, etc.

All data changes will be saved automatically into a file named data.json.

Screenshots demonstrating project actions are available inside the screenshots folder.

Files Included in the Project
main.py - Main program file containing the menu system
inventory.py - Contains core inventory operations (Add, Delete, Update, Search)
item.py - Defines the structure of an Item (ID, Name, Quantity, Price)
utils.py - Helper functions for saving/loading data and sorting
data.json - File where inventory data is stored persistently
screenshots/ - Folder containing screenshots of program execution
Inventory_Management_Project_Report.docx - The project report document for submission

Conclusion
This project showcases CRUD operations, data persistence, and the application of Data Structure concepts such as Lists, Dictionaries, Sorting, and Searching in a real-world use case. It is a strong demonstration of how DSA knowledge can be applied in a practical project.
